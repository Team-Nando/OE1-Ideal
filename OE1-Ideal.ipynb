    "# Assessment of Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs \n",
    "# OE Algorithm 1: Ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This work is part of the project [Assessing the Benefits of Using Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/assessing-the-benefits-of-OEs-across-Australia) funded by CSIRO. This project provided key metrics and recommendations for distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) and AEMO (the Australian system operator) to assist them in their decision-making process when defining the most suitable Operating Envelope (OE) implementations in a given distribution area.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:purple\">**What are Operating Envelopes (OEs)?** OEs are time-varying export or import limits calculated in real time or in advance at the connection point of the customer to ensure the integrity of the distribution network (i.e., customer voltages within limits and no asset congestion). The OEs are calculated only for customers with flexible connection agreements (called here *active customers*). Customers with conventional connection agreements (called here *passive customers*) do not require OEs.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This interactive notebook demonstrates the process to implement the *Ideal OE Algorithm*** produced by The University of Melbourne. This demonstration is useful for different stakeholders (e.g., DNSPs, AEMO, CSIRO, regulators, consultancy companies, technology providers) as it can help them familiarise with the corresponding algorithm and the required inputs as well as the pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:purple\">The **Ideal OE** is the most advanced and, hence, the most accurate operating envelope approach as it uses power flows to carry out calculations. However, it needs a full electrical network model and full monitoring of customers, which makes its implementation complex. If the electrical model and monitoring data are correct, it can guarantee the operation of the network within technical limits (i.e., voltage and thermal) as well as the maximum possible export and/or import limits. Therefore, this operating envelope is used as a benchmark for the simpler ones studied in the project.</span>\n",
    "> - Monitoring: At the secondary of the transformer (P, Q, and V, all per phase), at all customers (net demand P and Q).\n",
    "> - Electrical models needed: Full electrical network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Algorithm Overview\n",
    "The **Ideal OE** uses a perfect electrical network model of a given LV network together with the time-varying input data from the network and customers to carry out heuristic algorithms. These algorithms consist of a series of power flows calculations exploring exports/imports up to the point that a network limit (voltages or thermal) in any part of the LV network is breached. Two allocation techniques are used for the Ideal OE, as presented below. Note that for calculations in advance (e.g., hours ahead), forecasting capabilities are also needed (however, here, perfect forecasting is used for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proportional Allocation\n",
    "For a given point in time (e.g., at 12:00PM), the high-level steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Set up the network for power flow simulations for OE exports (or imports)**. This is done by using the LV electrical network model together with the voltage at the LV head of feeder and the net demand from passive customers (P, Q) and active customers (Q). Also set the net active power of all active customers to the maximum possible value for OE export (or imports). For OE exports, it could be the aggregated size of the DERs in the active customer (e.g., PV + battery with a total power of 10kW). For OE imports, it could be the fuse of the customer (e.g., 60A fuse for a single-phase customer, giving a total power of 14kW).\n",
    "2. **Run the power flow**.\n",
    "3. **Check for voltage and thermal issues in the whole network for the OE exports (or imports)**. If any network limit is breached (voltage or thermal), reduce the net active power of all active customers by a pre-defined value (e.g., 1kW), then go back to step 2. Otherwise, the current net active power of the active customers correspond to the OE exports (or imports), thus proceed to step 4.\n",
    "4. **Move to the next time step (e.g., 12:05PM) and restart the process from 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum Allocation\n",
    "1. **Set up the network for power flow simulations for OE exports (or imports)**. This is done by using the LV electrical network model together with the voltage at the LV head of feeder and the net demand from passive customers (P, Q) and active customers (Q). Also set the net active power of all active customers to the maximum possible value for OE export (or imports).

    "2. **Run the power flow**.\n",
    "3. **Check for thermal issues on the distribution transformer and lines for the OE exports (or imports)**. If any thermal limit is breached, reduce the net active power of all active customers by a pre-defined value (e.g., 1kW), then go back to step 2. Otherwise, proceed to step 4.\n",
    "4. **Check for voltage issues on customers for OE exports (or imports)**. If any voltage limit is breached, find the most affected (with the higher voltage) active customer and reduce its net active power by a pre-defined value (e.g., 1kW), then go back to step 2. Otherwise, the current net active power of the active customers correspond to the OE exports (or imports), thus proceed to step 5.\n",
    "5. **Move to the next time step (e.g., 12:05PM) and restart the process from 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 1</u>.</span>** The OE exports and OE imports are calculated separately. When calculating exports, all active customers are considered to export. When calculating imports, all active customers are considered to import. This ensures the asset integrity even if all active customers operate at their maximum allocated OE capacity (worst case scenario).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 2</u>.</span>** For OE calculations in real-time no forecast is needed, real-time measurements from the network/customers should be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 3</u>.</span>** The OE values are calculated for the active power only. The reactive power of PV systems are considered to be zero all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Inputs and Outputs for the OE Calculation Algorithm\n",
    "### Time-Varying Inputs\n",
    "- Forecasted voltage magnitude at the LV head of feeder (or secondary of the distribution transformer).\n",
    "- Forecasted net demand (P, Q) of all passive customer.\n",
    "- Forecasted net demand (Q) of all active customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Inputs\n",
    "- Accurate full electrical model of the LV network (i.e., topology, phase connection of assets and customers, and impedance of conductors).\n",
    "- Rated capacity of the distribution transformer and LV lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- The OEs for exports and imports. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Test LV Network\n",
    "To demonstrate the OE algorithm, the realistic Test LV network shown in Figure 1 is used. This network has the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Three 3-phase LV feeders.\n",
    "- 114 single-phase residential customers connected via service cables. \n",
    "- 16 (out of 114) are active customers (around 15%).\n",
    "- 98 (out of 114) are passive customers.\n",
    "- 35 of passive customers have PV systems (a PV penetration of 30% for the whole LV network).\n",
    "- The PV systems have the same installed capacity of 5kVA. They also have the combined Volt-Watt and Volt-Var functions enabled.\n",
    "- All active customers have the same DER installed capacity of 10kVA (e.g., PV + battery).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note</u>.</span>** For simplicity, the case study used to demonstrate the OE algorithm corresponds to a low voltage (LV) network without modelling the upstream high voltage (HV) network. Although some adaptations have been made to ensure realistic voltage fluctuations at the distribution transformer of the LV network, the results are not exactly the same as those presented in the Final Report of the project (which used an integrated HV-LV network model). Nevertheless, the behaviour of the OE algorithm and the qualitative nature of the results remain the same. The following adaptions were made:\n",
    "- The voltage variation along the day caused by the HV part is modelled as a voltage source (following the values taken from the full HV-LV model).\n",
    "- To better represent the voltage rise/drop at the primary side of the distribution transformer (due to OE exports/imports), a fictitious line is created between the voltage source and the distribution transformer.\n",
